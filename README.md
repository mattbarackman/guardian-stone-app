This Ruby on Rails application is part of a larger system I'm developing that will provide a 'pager duty' style alerting system showing the current location of a wheelchair bound friend if he ever falls out of his chair.

The onboard hardware consists of a Particle Electron 3G-enabled microcontroller with a GPS Shield for GPS-tracking. It uses a collection of web-hooks via the Particle eco-system to communicate with the web application. 

This web application will permit my friend to turn the onboard device on and off via his smart phone. It will also allow him to view his current location and view the remaining battery power of the device.
